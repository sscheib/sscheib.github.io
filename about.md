This my *personal* blog, where I post about things that I do and find interesting.

**Full disclosure: I currently work at Red Hat as Technical Account Manager.**

All posts and thoughts on this blog, however, are solely **my opinion** and are **not related to Red Hat**. Red Hat's views and mine *could* match, but they don't necessarily do.
